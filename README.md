Assignment: Work Day Scheduler

Description: Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. First, I psuedo coded to understand what I was doing and where I was going to put specefic things in my code. I was having issues with linking some of the jquery api's and I decided to just use a script tag for all my JavaScript and JQuery code within my HTML page. Second, I added in all of the html elements and gave them specific class and id names that would link to the jquery. Third, linked dom elements with jquery and set up local storage for webpage. Finally, made changes to HTML and CSS for styling and formatting.
